## üìñ Key Concepts Explained

### Modified Nodal Analysis (MNA)
**Where to learn:**
- [SIMULATOR_ARCHITECTURE.md](./SIMULATOR_ARCHITECTURE.md) - Section 2 (comprehensive)
- [INTERNALS.md](./INTERNALS.md) - Section "Internals" (concise)
- [External resource](https://lpsa.swarthmore.edu/Systems/Electrical/mna/MNA1.html)

**Summary:** MNA is the mathematical method used to solve circuits. It creates a system of linear equations (matrix) representing Kirchhoff's laws and Ohm's law, then solves for node voltages and branch currents.

### LU Decomposition
**Where to learn:**
- [REACTJS_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](./REACTJS_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) - Complete implementation
- [SIMULATOR_ARCHITECTURE.md](./SIMULATOR_ARCHITECTURE.md) - Section 9 (algorithms)

**Summary:** LU decomposition factors a matrix into lower and upper triangular matrices, making it efficient to solve the same system multiple times with different right-hand sides.

### Circuit Elements
**Where to learn:**
- [SIMULATOR_ARCHITECTURE.md](./SIMULATOR_ARCHITECTURE.md) - Section 5 (architecture)
- [REACTJS_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](./REACTJS_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) - Complete implementations
- [ADVANCED_COMPONENTS_GUIDE.md](./ADVANCED_COMPONENTS_GUIDE.md) - Advanced components
- [INTERNALS.md](./INTERNALS.md) - "Adding New Elements"

**Summary:** Each circuit component (resistor, capacitor, etc.) is a class that knows how to:
1. Stamp its contribution into the MNA matrix
2. Update its state each timestep
3. Draw itself on the canvas

### Nonlinear Components
**Where to learn:**
- [SIMULATOR_ARCHITECTURE.md](./SIMULATOR_ARCHITECTURE.md) - Section 5 (diode example)
- [ADVANCED_COMPONENTS_GUIDE.md](./ADVANCED_COMPONENTS_GUIDE.md) - Section 2
- [INTERNALS.md](./INTERNALS.md) - Discussion of iteration

**Summary:** Nonlinear components (diodes, transistors) use iterative solving. At each iteration, they linearize their behavior around the current operating point, creating a tangent-line approximation that can be stamped into the matrix.

### Numerical Integration
**Where to learn:**
- [SIMULATOR_ARCHITECTURE.md](./SIMULATOR_ARCHITECTURE.md) - Section 5 (capacitor/inductor)
- [INTERNALS.md](./INTERNALS.md) - Discussion of time-stepping

**Summary:** Capacitors and inductors store energy and their state changes over time. The simulator uses numerical integration (trapezoidal or backward Euler methods) to approximate their behavior by taking small time steps.

## üîß Code Examples Quick Reference

### Create a Simple Circuit (JavaScript)
```javascript
const simulator = new CircuitSimulator();

// Add 5V source
const voltage = new VoltageSource(100, 100, 100, 200, 5);
simulator.addElement(voltage);

// Add 1kŒ© resistor
const resistor = new Resistor(100, 200, 200, 200, 1000);
simulator.addElement(resistor);

// Add wire to close circuit
const wire = new Wire(200, 200, 200, 100);
simulator.addElement(wire);

// Simulate
simulator.simulate();

// Read results
console.log('Current:', resistor.current); // Should be 5V / 1000Œ© = 0.005A
```

### Implement a New Component
```typescript
class MyComponent extends CircuitElement {
  // 1. Define properties
  myParameter: number;

  // 2. Implement stamp() for linear contribution
  stamp(sim: CircuitSimulator): void {
    // Add to matrix here
  }

  // 3. Implement doStep() for per-timestep updates
  doStep(sim: CircuitSimulator): void {
    // Update matrix/state here
  }

  // 4. Implement draw() for visualization
  draw(ctx: CanvasRenderingContext2D): void {
    // Render element here
  }
}
```

### Matrix Operations
```typescript
// Create and factor matrix
const solver = new MatrixSolver();
const matrix = [[2, -1], [-1, 2]];
solver.luFactor(matrix);

// Solve Ax = b
const b = [1, 1];
const x = [0, 0];
solver.luSolve(matrix, b, x);
// x now contains [1, 1]
```
